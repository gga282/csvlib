# csvlib

**Note:** This is an unfinished project created in a short time as a learning exercise.  
The goal of this project is to build a lightweight CSV file handler **without using Pythonâ€™s built-in `csv` or `pandas` libraries**.

It focuses on manually reading, parsing, and manipulating CSV data using basic file I/O and string operations.
